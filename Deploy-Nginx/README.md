# Deploy NGINX Proxy to Prod

This ansible playbook was an attempt to

Deploy a Proxmox VM from clone
Configure VM network settings
Configure VM (Install Docker)
Deploy my NGINX docker container
Depoy Configs

The Idea is to run this playbook to bring my Proxy server up an in an operational state.



## TODO
 - deploy nginx container
 - deploy configs
 - workout backup crons
 - DNS entry for VM
 - Modularize configs
 - DNS Entries for configs
